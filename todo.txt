CHANGE TASK TO OBJECT, UPDATE RENDERS
use react datepicker, each task in the array will now have task string and date, 
when dates are rendered its a map function that renders a div for each thing in array, just add the date
(pass date to date component and render the difference between now and future date)
(or just say due at etc)

UPDATE FUNCTION PASSED DOWN
when you do taskinputfield it sends add function that updates task state in app TO the component, so just make 
sure that you add a date when youre making a new task object
think of dipping a bucket from app into taskinput and taking it back up

STREAK:
streak is also now going to be app state variable-use react swipe, if swipe left delete if swipe right complete
if swipe right before date then streak +1

find a thing that makes it render every tick, and then every time check if front of PRIORITY QUEUE is over current date
if so set streak to 0

REMINDER-
youll have to add this to the task object, a time to REMINDER
if this time passes, (check top of PRIORITYqueue )then send reminder
