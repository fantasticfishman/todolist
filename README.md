This is a todolist mobile app that attempts to help users keep their productivity by allowing them to set tasks with due dates, and increasing their "streak"
if they complete the task on time. Because a picture is worth a thousand words, I've recorded a video demo below(some of the components like alerts and date pickers
don't work on the web, so I can't host a live demo).
